## Communication and Collaboration Tools

Because of the highly collaborative nature of the course, we’ll be using a variety of online tools that support collaboration, sharing, and openness.

- **[MyCourses](http://mycourses.unh.edu)** for student email communication with me and important announcements (also communicated via Slack). The site has links to this course syllabus, course repository in Google Drive, and Slack.
- **[Slack](https://2019-fall-comp525.slack.com)** (see Class Chat below) for the class "chat room" with channels for announcements, assignments, and project team work.
- **[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)** for teaching resources and student learning portfolios
- **[GitHub](https://github.com)** for maintaining and submitting the codebase of your programming assignments.
   -You will use the GitHub Student Developer Pack at https://education.github.com/pack/join (Links to an external site.) to maintain your GitHub private repositories free of charge.
- **[Class-Linked Tutor and Center for Academic Enrichment](/comp525.github.io/docs/staff/tutors)** (CAE) Tutoring Services
   - This class also has a class-linked tutor who'll be in class to help with all the learning activities. The class-linked tutor and other tutors in the Center for Academic Enrichment (CAE) are well-prepared to assist with questions, lab and homework assignments, and Python programming.

- **[Student Tech Consultants](/comp525.github.io/docs/staff/techs)**
   - The Computing  Program in the Department of Applied Engineering and Sciences has student tech consultants who are available to help with software configuration and other technical questions you might have. You’ll find them in the Tech Consultancy Workroom 124. Working hours are displayed on the door.

- **Course Repository**
   - Teaching materials and resources will reside in a publicly shared Google Drive folder, unh-comp-525 at bit.ly/2KGIejM (Links to an external site.), which I call course repository. It includes this syllabus, weekly slides, and other materials. MyCourses site for this course has a link to the Google Drive course repository.

- **Laptop**
   - You have the choice to either use your own laptop or get a laptop from the department. You can use the operating system you are more comfortable with: Mac OSX,  Ubuntu or other Linux distribution, or Windows.

## Development Tools

The development tools you'll learn to configure, install, and use are:

- Bash shell  or [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (if using Windows)
- [Python 3.7.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) or another text editor available for both OSX and Linux distribution OS.
