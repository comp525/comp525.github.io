# Teaching and Learning Strategies

**"For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them,"  
-Aristotle, ~350 BC**

Learning in this class depends heavily on active participation and open collaboration in and outside class. Because of the interactive nature of the online textbook, a lot of first exposure to content and practices you'll learn in this course will happen through regular engagement with the content and all activities in the  book. Therefore, my teaching won't be based on lecturing.

--------

## In-Class Learning

The course semester has 15 weeks with weekly 2 hour and 50 minute class meetings. These class meetings are structured to create a lab-based guided learning environment.  What does it mean? Lab exercises and problems given in class will consist of learning tasks that will prompt your attention to core concepts, programming patterns, and problem solving strategies. You will work in teams or individually and  explore, question, and explain how key ideas in data structures and algorithms apply to solve computational problems. Focus will be on developing skills including communication, critical thinking, problem solving, and teamwork. Lab-based guided learning  will give you ample practice to apply your understanding of core concepts in new contexts.

--------

## Outside Class Learning

You are expected to study 6-8  hours outside class every week. Outside class time is dedicated to independent and collaborative study to finish the labs, reflect on your own work, collaborate with peers, work on the course project, reflect on your team's work, participate in outside class ongoing communication, and develop and feature your artifacts using a learning portfolio (non-coding) and GitHub repository (coding and coding-related).

--------

## Autograded Work

Much of the assigned work will be automatically graded. This means that you will get immediate feedback as you learn through the book's activities and test your answers or solutions.  You are encouraged to keep working and get as many of the automatic tests to pass as you can. You WILL NOT be penalized for making lots of tries.

For example, the active code tool that you'll use to solve programming problems has a history slider. Every new version of your program is saved, and you can always go back to a previous version if something you try doesn't work, use the history slider to explore new ways of solving the problem. We will learn in this course how to turn failure in our friend.
