# COURSE POLICIES

## Attendance

Attendance is taken every class. You are responsible for attending all classes and expected to abide by the University Policy on Attendance as stated in the UNH Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities.

If you miss a class, you take the responsibility to do the following three things.

- Email me about the circumstances for missing the class within a week of the absence using MyCourses email.
- Contact your peers to find out what youâ€™ve missed
- Make up the absence by doing the work assigned that week
- Failing to meet this responsibility results in a reduction of 5% of your final grade.

## Late Submissions

You will lose 10% per day for late homework assignment submission for three days after the due date. Three days after the due date homework will not be accepted and a zero will be given.

Reading assignments, reflections and labs will not be accepted after the deadline and a zero will be given.

Prior approval to submit after the deadline

In case of serious circumstances beyond your control such documented illness, accidents, emergencies, or other events, you can receive approval to submit after the deadline ONLY IF you take the responsibility to do the following:

- Email me PRIOR to the deadline AND
- Explain circumstances that have prevented you from meeting the class requirement.
