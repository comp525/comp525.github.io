# Course Goals

The goal of the course is to formulate and solve problems with computational approaches that use data structures and computing tools.

Solving computational problems with data structures means to:

- Design and build computational solutions that apply computer science concepts and data structures
Observe  computational system behavior, form hypotheses about that behavior, and debug, test, and improve the system.
- Problem solving with computations is about formulating problems, thinking creatively about solutions, and expressing those solutions using programming and computing tools.

--------

## Data Structures Competencies

### - Skills

- Design and implement data and functional abstractions
- Analyze and select appropriate data structures to solve computational problems
- Practice programming and software development techniques to implement computational solutions
- Communicate and collaborate with others to achieve a common goal or solution.

### - Dispositions

**“Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,”  
-Winston Churchill**

Achieving the course learning objectives will help form the following attitudes and dispositions:

- Reflect on your learning experiences.
- Persist in working with difficult problems
- Adapt, adjust, change course, be flexible as needed
- Tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity
- “Walk in another’s shoes” to learn more about other perspectives, show empathy, consider various points of view, and recognize and avoid bias
- Have confidence in dealing with complexity
- Communicate and work with others to achieve a common goal.
