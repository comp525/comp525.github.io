# COURSE REQUIREMENTS

--------

## Learning Portfolio

Some of your  non-coding work is created and maintained in your learning portfolio, for which you will  use Google Drive. The learning portfolio will have reflections and non-coding artifacts related to your lab activities, homework designs, and team project. Portfolios are  evaluated for completion at the end of the semester. There is a 5% penalty of your final grade for an incomplete portfolio.

--------

## GitHub Code Repositories

All your coding-related work is committed to your GitHub account. You must request access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack at https://education.github.com/pack/join (Links to an external site.).

--------

## Class Chat Participation

Outside class communication uses Slack https://2019-fall-comp525.slack.com (Links to an external site.). You will use the channels in Slack to reach out to your peers for support and offer your support.

--------

## Active Reading (15%)

Reading assignments are excellent opportunities to actively engage with the course content every week through various activities such as answering multiple-choice questions, writing short answers or filling in the blank, and coding. The reading assignments are auto-graded. Use the auto-grading feature to keep working and improve your answers and solutions. Needless to say the reading assignments are entirely your own individual work.

All reading assignments are due Tuesday 11:59 PM. Reading assignments are NOT accepted after the deadline.  

--------

## Collaborative Labs (5%)

You will engage in collaborative lab activities almost every class, except for classes dedicated to project work or with scheduled midterm and final exam. Through these activities you'll produce code repositories in your GitHub account and non-coding artifacts in your Google Drive. Labs are designed to be started and completed during the class meeting time. If you don't finish the lab in class, you need to complete it before next class, on Wednesday 12:00 PM. Lab submissions are not accepted after the deadline.

--------

## Reflections (10%)

Reflecting on your learning experience and sharing your perspectives is also valued in this course. Reflections are well-thought answers to guiding prompts. No credit is received for big, general statements that say little about your specific experience. There will be around eight reflections during the semester, and they are due at the date and time listed in MyCourses (no later than Wednesday 12:00 pm on the due date).

Reflections are NOT accepted after the deadline.

--------

## Homework Problems (20%)
Solving the homework problems is your own individual work. No collaboration is allowed as you prepare the homework artifacts, which include designs in your learning portfolio and code in your GitHub account. There will be at least five homework assignments as shown in the Tentative Schedule section.

Homework problems are due at the date and time listed in MyCourses (no later than Wednesday 12:00 pm on the due date). If you do not meet the required deadline, Late Submissions Policy will apply as explained in the Course Policies section.

--------

## Team Project (10%)

There is a team project to investigate a problem or issue of interest that benefits from designing and implementing data structures. Project artifacts include a demo of the codebase (5%) and a final report (5%). The final report is created and completed in your Google Drive learning portfolio and the codebased is in a GitHub repository. These project artifacts are due at the date and time listed in MyCourses (no later than Wednesday 12:00 pm on the due date).  

--------

## Exams (40%)
There is a midterm exam (7th week of the semester) and comprehensive final exam (last week of the semester). Each exam is 20% of the final grade.  The exams are closed books,  paper and pencil based, and assess problem solving skills, application of concepts, and demonstration of programming techniques.
