    "content": "Course Goals . The goal of the course is to formulate and solve problems with computational approaches that use data structures and computing tools. . Solving computational problems with data structures means to: . Design and build computational solutions that apply computer science concepts and data structures Observe computational system behavior, form hypotheses about that behavior, and debug, test, and improve the system. | Problem solving with computations is about formulating problems, thinking creatively about solutions, and expressing those solutions using programming and computing tools. | . . Data Structures Competencies . - Skills . Design and implement data and functional abstractions | Analyze and select appropriate data structures to solve computational problems | Practice programming and software development techniques to implement computational solutions | Communicate and collaborate with others to achieve a common goal or solution. | . - Dispositions . “Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,” -Winston Churchill . Achieving the course learning objectives will help form the following attitudes and dispositions: . Reflect on your learning experiences. | Persist in working with difficult problems | Adapt, adjust, change course, be flexible as needed | Tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity | “Walk in another’s shoes” to learn more about other perspectives, show empathy, consider various points of view, and recognize and avoid bias | Have confidence in dealing with complexity | Communicate and work with others to achieve a common goal. | .",

    "content": "COURSE REQUIREMENTS . . Learning Portfolio . Some of your non-coding work is created and maintained in your learning portfolio, for which you will use Google Drive. The learning portfolio will have reflections and non-coding artifacts related to your lab activities, homework designs, and team project. Portfolios are evaluated for completion at the end of the semester. There is a 5% penalty of your final grade for an incomplete portfolio. . . GitHub Code Repositories . All your coding-related work is committed to your GitHub account. You must request access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack at https://education.github.com/pack/join (Links to an external site.). . . Class Chat Participation . Outside class communication uses Slack https://2019-fall-comp525.slack.com (Links to an external site.). You will use the channels in Slack to reach out to your peers for support and offer your support. . . Active Reading (15%) . Reading assignments are excellent opportunities to actively engage with the course content every week through various activities such as answering multiple-choice questions, writing short answers or filling in the blank, and coding. The reading assignments are auto-graded. Use the auto-grading feature to keep working and improve your answers and solutions. Needless to say the reading assignments are entirely your own individual work. . All reading assignments are due Tuesday 11:59 PM. Reading assignments are NOT accepted after the deadline. . . Collaborative Labs (5%) . You will engage in collaborative lab activities almost every class, except for classes dedicated to project work or with scheduled midterm and final exam. Through these activities you’ll produce code repositories in your GitHub account and non-coding artifacts in your Google Drive. Labs are designed to be started and completed during the class meeting time. If you don’t finish the lab in class, you need to complete it before next class, on Wednesday 12:00 PM. Lab submissions are not accepted after the deadline. . . Reflections (10%) . Reflecting on your learning experience and sharing your perspectives is also valued in this course. Reflections are well-thought answers to guiding prompts. No credit is received for big, general statements that say little about your specific experience. There will be around eight reflections during the semester, and they are due at the date and time listed in MyCourses (no later than Wednesday 12:00 pm on the due date). . Reflections are NOT accepted after the deadline. . . Homework Problems (20%) . Solving the homework problems is your own individual work. No collaboration is allowed as you prepare the homework artifacts, which include designs in your learning portfolio and code in your GitHub account. There will be at least five homework assignments as shown in the Tentative Schedule section. . Homework problems are due at the date and time listed in MyCourses (no later than Wednesday 12:00 pm on the due date). If you do not meet the required deadline, Late Submissions Policy will apply as explained in the Course Policies section. . . Team Project (10%) . There is a team project to investigate a problem or issue of interest that benefits from designing and implementing data structures. Project artifacts include a demo of the codebase (5%) and a final report (5%). The final report is created and completed in your Google Drive learning portfolio and the codebased is in a GitHub repository. These project artifacts are due at the date and time listed in MyCourses (no later than Wednesday 12:00 pm on the due date). . . Exams (40%) . There is a midterm exam (7th week of the semester) and comprehensive final exam (last week of the semester). Each exam is 20% of the final grade. The exams are closed books, paper and pencil based, and assess problem solving skills, application of concepts, and demonstration of programming techniques. .",

    "title": "Teaching and Learning Strategies",
    "content": "Teaching and Learning Strategies . “For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them,” -Aristotle, ~350 BC . Learning in this class depends heavily on active participation and open collaboration in and outside class. Because of the interactive nature of the online textbook, a lot of first exposure to content and practices you’ll learn in this course will happen through regular engagement with the content and all activities in the book. Therefore, my teaching won’t be based on lecturing. . . In-Class Learning . The course semester has 15 weeks with weekly 2 hour and 50 minute class meetings. These class meetings are structured to create a lab-based guided learning environment. What does it mean? Lab exercises and problems given in class will consist of learning tasks that will prompt your attention to core concepts, programming patterns, and problem solving strategies. You will work in teams or individually and explore, question, and explain how key ideas in data structures and algorithms apply to solve computational problems. Focus will be on developing skills including communication, critical thinking, problem solving, and teamwork. Lab-based guided learning will give you ample practice to apply your understanding of core concepts in new contexts. . . Outside Class Learning . You are expected to study 6-8 hours outside class every week. Outside class time is dedicated to independent and collaborative study to finish the labs, reflect on your own work, collaborate with peers, work on the course project, reflect on your team’s work, participate in outside class ongoing communication, and develop and feature your artifacts using a learning portfolio (non-coding) and GitHub repository (coding and coding-related). . . Autograded Work . Much of the assigned work will be automatically graded. This means that you will get immediate feedback as you learn through the book’s activities and test your answers or solutions. You are encouraged to keep working and get as many of the automatic tests to pass as you can. You WILL NOT be penalized for making lots of tries. . For example, the active code tool that you’ll use to solve programming problems has a history slider. Every new version of your program is saved, and you can always go back to a previous version if something you try doesn’t work, use the history slider to explore new ways of solving the problem. We will learn in this course how to turn failure in our friend. .",
